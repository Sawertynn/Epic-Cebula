# Epic-Cebula
### This is a hobby project aimed to learn automation in Python, very likely it's not the best way to do the job

Do you want some free games from Epic, but not to press some boring buttons every week? No problem, this script got you covered.

This is an early prototype yet: 
- script must be started manually, every week
- takes whole screen, slowly wanders around app and buttons
- poorly tested, only on mine machine (1920x1080 screen)
- messy code & a lot of hiding bugs

## Requirements:
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [PyAutoGUI](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) module
- Epic Games Launcher (permanently logged in)

## Usage:
Click on run.bat or run epic-cebula.py in python.
